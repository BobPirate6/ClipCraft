## 17. Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Pinch Zoom Gesture Conflicts
**Problem**: In VideoTimeline, adding a transparent overlay for pinch-to-zoom gesture detection blocked all other gestures (selection, dragging, trimming).

**Solution**: Instead of using an overlay, add the `pointerInput` modifier directly to the main Box container:
```kotlin
Box(
    modifier = modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .height(120.dp)
        .pointerInput(Unit) {
            detectTransformGestures { _, _, zoom, _ ->
                val newZoom = (currentZoom * zoom).coerceIn(minZoom, maxZoom)
                currentZoom = newZoom
                onZoomChange(newZoom)
            }
        }
)
```

### Issue: Navigation Loop After Voice Editing
**Problem**: When using voice command from the video editor, the app would navigate to the main screen and then immediately reopen the editor, creating a navigation loop.

**Root Cause**: A `LaunchedEffect` in NewMainScreen automatically navigates to VideoEditor when `ProcessingState.Success` and `EditingState.mode == EDIT`.

**Solution**: Added a flag `isVoiceEditingFromEditor` to EditingState to track when voice editing is initiated from the editor, preventing automatic navigation:
```kotlin
// In EditingState
data class EditingState(
    // ... other fields ...
    val isVoiceEditingFromEditor: Boolean = false
)

// In NewMainScreen
LaunchedEffect(processingState, editingState.mode, editingState.isVoiceEditingFromEditor) {
    if (processingState is ProcessingState.Success && 
        editingState.mode == ProcessingMode.EDIT &&
        !editingState.isVoiceEditingFromEditor) {
        viewModel.navigateTo(MainViewModel.Screen.VideoEditor)
    }
}
```

### Issue: Process Button Not Appearing After Voice Input
**Problem**: The process button only appeared after keyboard input, not after voice input.

**Solution**: Updated `handleVoiceResult` to force UI recomposition by reassigning the value:
```kotlin
fun handleVoiceResult(result: String) {
    if (result.isNotBlank()) {
        _userCommand.value = result
        // Force recomposition
        _userCommand.value = _userCommand.value
    }
}
```

### Issue: Text Field Pushing Process Button Off Screen
**Problem**: As text input expanded, it pushed the process button beyond the screen edge.

**Solution**: Restructured the layout with proper constraints and fixed widths to prevent overflow.

### Issue: Single Finger Movement Triggering Zoom
**Problem**: Even single finger movements were triggering zoom events with factor 1.0.

**Solution**: The `detectTransformGestures` naturally handles multi-touch gestures only. The issue was caused by the overlay intercepting all touch events. Removing the overlay and applying the gesture detector to the main container resolved this.

### Issue: Pinch Zoom Required Specific Finger Placement [GESTURE-FIX]
**Problem**: Pinch zoom in video timeline only worked when placing one finger on a segment and another outside. The gesture needed to work regardless of finger placement order or position.

**Solution**: Implemented a unified GestureDetector with `awaitEachGesture()` at the timeline level with gesture priorities:
- 2+ fingers → Pinch zoom (highest priority)
- 1 finger → Context-based gesture detection (tap, drag, trim)

**Implementation Details** (VideoTimeline.kt):
```kotlin
// Single unified gesture handler at timeline level
.pointerInput(Unit) {
    awaitEachGesture {
        // Track all active pointers
        val down = awaitFirstDown(requireUnconsumed = false)
        val pointers = mutableMapOf(down.id to down)
        
        // Determine gesture type based on pointer count
        when {
            pointers.size >= 2 -> handlePinchZoom(pointers)
            pointers.size == 1 -> handleSinglePointerGesture(down)
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- Removed conflicting gesture handlers from individual segments
- Centralized state management through GestureState
- Unified pointer tracking for all gesture types
- Clear gesture priority hierarchy

**Result**: All gestures now work correctly without conflicts, and pinch zoom responds immediately regardless of finger placement.

### Issue: VideoTimeline.kt File Corruption [BUG-FIX]
**Problem**: The VideoTimeline.kt file became corrupted with duplicate code starting from line 522. The duplicated section included partial implementations of gesture handling logic that interfered with the proper functioning of the component.

**Root Cause**: Likely caused by an incomplete edit operation or merge conflict that resulted in duplicated code blocks within the main Box composable.

**Solution**: Remove the corrupted duplicate code section from lines 522-648 while preserving the correct implementation. The file should maintain its proper structure with:
1. Single VideoTimeline composable function
2. Single VideoSegmentItem composable function  
3. Helper components (TrimHandle, TimeRuler, Playhead)
4. Utility functions and data classes

**Implementation Details**:
- Lines 1-521: Valid code (keep)
- Lines 522-648: Corrupted duplicate code (remove)
- Lines 649-1273: Valid continuation of the component (keep, but renumber)

**Key Indicators of Corruption**:
- Duplicate gesture handling logic mid-function
- Broken control flow with unreachable code
- Missing opening braces for the duplicated section
- Inconsistent indentation and structure

**Result**: After removing the corrupted section, the VideoTimeline component should function properly with all gesture handling, drag-and-drop, and trimming features intact.

### Issue: Duplicate Video Editing Services [CODE-CLEANUP]
**Problem**: The codebase contains two separate video editing services with overlapping functionality:
- `VideoEditorService`: Used by ProcessVideosUseCase and VideoProcessingRepository for executing edit plans
- `VideoEditingService`: Used by VideoEditorViewModel for manual video editing operations

**Analysis**:
1. **VideoEditorService** (app/src/main/java/com/example/clipcraft/services/VideoEditorService.kt):
   - Focuses on executing EditPlan objects from AI processing
   - Uses Media3 Transformer for video composition
   - Handles export settings and progress callbacks
   - Injected via Hilt as @Singleton

2. **VideoEditingService** (app/src/main/java/com/example/clipcraft/services/VideoEditingService.kt):
   - Provides lower-level video manipulation functions
   - Includes thumbnail generation, video info extraction
   - Also uses Media3 Transformer but for different operations
   - Also injected via Hilt as @Singleton

**Recommendations**:
1. **Consolidate Services**: Merge both services into a single `VideoEditingService` that handles both AI-driven and manual editing operations
2. **Clear Separation**: If keeping both, rename to clarify purpose:
   - `AIVideoEditingService` for AI-driven edit plan execution
   - `ManualVideoEditingService` for user-initiated edits
3. **Shared Utilities**: Extract common functionality (transformer setup, progress handling) into a base class or utility service

### Issue: Package Structure Inconsistencies [CODE-CLEANUP]
**Problem**: The package structure shows some organizational issues that affect code maintainability:

**Current Issues**:
1. **Misplaced Files**:
   - `MainActivityUtils.kt` is in the root java folder instead of a utils package
   - `MainActivity.kt` and `ClipCraftApplication.kt` are in the root instead of a presentation/app package

2. **Naming Inconsistencies**:
   - Mix of singular and plural package names (e.g., `models`, `screens`, `services`)
   - `ui` package contains ViewModels but also has a `theme` subpackage

3. **Layer Confusion**:
   - Services are mixed between business logic and infrastructure concerns
   - No clear separation between data sources and repositories

**Recommendations**:
1. **Reorganize Root Files**:
   ```
   com.example.clipcraft/
   ├── app/
   │   ├── ClipCraftApplication.kt
   │   └── MainActivity.kt
   ├── utils/
   │   ├── MainActivityUtils.kt
   │   └── FirebaseExtensions.kt
   ```

2. **Standardize Package Names**:
   - Use singular form consistently: `model`, `screen`, `service`, `component`
   - Or use plural form consistently: `models`, `screens`, `services`, `components`

3. **Clarify UI Package**:
   ```
   presentation/
   ├── viewmodel/
   │   ├── MainViewModel.kt
   │   └── VideoEditorViewModel.kt
   ├── theme/
   │   ├── Theme.kt
   │   └── Typography.kt
   ```

### Issue: Unused Imports and Dead Code [CODE-CLEANUP]
**Problem**: While a comprehensive scan didn't reveal widespread unused imports, manual inspection shows potential cleanup opportunities:

**Identified Issues**:
1. **Backup Files**: `VideoTimeline.kt.backup` should be removed from version control
2. **Potential Unused Services**: Need to verify if both video editing services are actively used
3. **Import Organization**: Imports should be organized consistently (Android, AndroidX, third-party, project imports)

**Recommendations**:
1. **Configure IDE**: Set up Android Studio to automatically organize and optimize imports on save
2. **Add Lint Rules**: Configure ktlint or detekt to catch unused imports and enforce import ordering
3. **Regular Cleanup**: Establish a practice of running "Optimize Imports" before commits

### Issue: VideoTimelineNew Compilation Errors [TIMELINE-COMPILATION]
**Problem**: When implementing new timeline requirements in VideoTimelineNew.kt, compilation failed with multiple errors:
1. Redeclaration of GestureType, GestureState, and SegmentInfo (already declared in VideoTimeline.kt)
2. Cannot access private declarations between files
3. Unresolved reference to nativeCanvas in Canvas drawing

**Solution**: 
1. Renamed conflicting types in VideoTimelineNew.kt:
   - `GestureType` → `GestureTypeNew`
   - `GestureState` → `GestureStateNew`
   - `SegmentInfo` → `SegmentInfoNew`
   - `findSegmentAtPosition` → `findSegmentAtPositionNew`

2. Fixed Canvas text drawing by importing proper extensions:
   ```kotlin
   import androidx.compose.ui.graphics.drawscope.drawIntoCanvas
   import androidx.compose.ui.graphics.nativeCanvas
   
   // In Canvas scope:
   drawIntoCanvas { canvas ->
       canvas.nativeCanvas.drawText(text, x, y, paint)
   }
   ```

**Result**: VideoTimelineNew.kt now compiles successfully with all new requirements implemented:
- Discrete zoom buttons (+/-) instead of pinch zoom
- Adaptive time ruler with dynamic tick intervals
- Improved trim functionality where edges follow finger
- Drag to reorder with visual feedback
- Removed unnecessary UI elements (drag icon, close button)

### Issue: Timeline Gesture Responsiveness [TIMELINE-RESPONSIVENESS]
**Problem**: Trim and drag gestures had poor responsiveness due to:
1. 300ms delay before drag gesture activation
2. Using NONE state instead of immediate gesture detection
3. No real-time visual feedback for trimming

**Solution**:
1. Removed drag delay - gestures now start immediately:
   ```kotlin
   // Before: Wait 300ms then activate drag
   if (System.currentTimeMillis() - gestureState.dragStartTime > 300) {
       gestureState = gestureState.copy(type = GestureTypeNew.DRAG_SEGMENT)
   }
   
   // After: Immediate activation
   gestureState = gestureState.copy(
       type = GestureTypeNew.DRAG_SEGMENT,
       targetSegmentId = targetSegment.id
   )
   draggedSegment = targetSegment.segment
   draggedFromIndex = targetSegment.index
   ```

2. Real-time visual feedback for trimming:
   - Segment width changes as user drags: `visualWidthPx = baseWidthPx + rightTrimOffset - leftTrimOffset`
   - Left trim moves entire segment: `offset(x = leftTrimOffset.toDp())`
   - Duration display updates in real-time
   - Visual trim handles appear for selected segments

3. Added visual indicators:
   - Trim handles (32dp zones) with highlighting when active
   - Thin lines (2dp) always visible on selected segments
   - Colored overlay (primary color with 30% alpha) during active trimming

**Result**: Gestures now respond instantly with smooth visual feedback. Users can:
- Start trimming immediately when touching segment edges
- See segment size change in real-time as they drag
- Start drag & drop without any delay
- Get clear visual feedback about which gesture is active

### Issue: Timeline Complete Rewrite [TIMELINE-REWRITE]
**Problem**: Previous implementation had fundamental issues:
1. pointerInput on LazyRow caused gesture conflicts
2. Complex state management led to delays and unresponsive gestures
3. Trim gestures required holding finger for several seconds
4. Visual feedback didn't follow finger movement in real-time

**Solution**: Complete rewrite in VideoTimelineSimple.kt with:
1. **Direct gesture handling on segments**:
   ```kotlin
   .pointerInput(segment.id, isSelected) {
       detectDragGestures(
           onDragStart = { offset ->
               // Immediate gesture detection based on position
               when {
                   offset.x < edgeThreshold -> trimType = TrimType.LEFT
                   offset.x > size.width - edgeThreshold -> trimType = TrimType.RIGHT
                   else -> isDragging = true
               }
           }
       )
   }
   ```

2. **Real-time trim feedback**:
   - Apply trim changes during drag, not just on end
   - Segment width updates immediately
   - Duration label updates in real-time
   - Visual indicators (colored lines) show active trim state

3. **Simplified drag & drop**:
   - No delays - drag starts immediately
   - Visual feedback with elevation and scale
   - Clear drop position calculation

4. **Clean architecture**:
   - Each segment handles its own gestures
   - No global gesture state
   - LazyRow scrolling works naturally

**Key improvements**:
- Removed complex GestureState management
- Eliminated all delays (300ms wait removed)
- Direct pointerInput on each segment
- Real-time visual updates during gestures
- Immediate response to finger movement

**Result**: Timeline now has instant, smooth gesture response. Trim works by touching edge and dragging immediately. Drag & drop activates instantly from center. All visual feedback follows finger movement in real-time.

### Issue: Timeline Functionality Requirements [TIMELINE-REQUIREMENTS]
**Purpose**: Document the comprehensive requirements for the video timeline component to ensure all gesture interactions, UI elements, and editing capabilities work cohesively.

**Core Timeline Features**:

1. **Zoom Controls**:
   - **Pinch-to-Zoom**: Two-finger pinch gesture for timeline scaling (range: 0.5x to 5.0x)
   - **Zoom Behavior**: Zoom centered around gesture midpoint
   - **Visual Feedback**: Real-time timeline scale updates during zoom
   - **Constraints**: Minimum zoom shows all segments, maximum zoom allows frame-level precision

2. **Drag to Reorder**:
   - **Activation**: Long-press (500ms) or immediate drag from segment center
   - **Visual States**: 
     - Normal: Standard segment appearance
     - Dragging: Elevated shadow, 10% scale increase, slight transparency
     - Drop Zone: Highlighted insertion point between segments
   - **Behavior**: 
     - Smooth animation during drag
     - Auto-scroll when dragging near timeline edges
     - Snap-to-position on drop
     - Preserve segment duration during reorder

3. **Trim Functionality**:
   - **Trim Handles**: 
     - Left edge: Adjust start time
     - Right edge: Adjust end time
     - Handle size: 40dp x full height
     - Visual: Semi-transparent overlay with drag indicator
   - **Constraints**:
     - Minimum segment duration: 0.5 seconds
     - Cannot trim beyond original video boundaries
     - Cannot overlap adjacent segments
   - **Feedback**:
     - Real-time duration display during trim
     - Snapping to nearest frame at high zoom levels
     - Preview update on trim completion

4. **UI Elements**:

   a. **Timeline Container**:
      - Height: 120dp default
      - Background: Subtle gradient or solid color
      - Scrollable horizontally with momentum
      - Edge shadows for scroll indication

   b. **Video Segments**:
      - Height: 80dp
      - Margin: 8dp vertical, 4dp horizontal between segments
      - Thumbnail: Representative frame from video
      - Duration overlay: Bottom-right corner
      - Selection indicator: 2dp border when selected

   c. **Time Ruler**:
      - Position: Top of timeline
      - Height: 24dp
      - Major ticks: Every second at 1x zoom
      - Minor ticks: Adjust based on zoom level
      - Time labels: HH:MM:SS.MS format

   d. **Playhead**:
      - Width: 2dp
      - Color: Primary theme color
      - Height: Full timeline height
      - Shadow for visibility
      - Smooth animation during playback

   e. **Control Buttons**:
      - Play/Pause: Floating action button
      - Zoom Reset: Icon button (optional)
      - Timeline Lock: Prevent accidental edits (optional)

5. **Gesture Priority System**:
   ```
   Priority Order (highest to lowest):
   1. Two-finger pinch → Zoom
   2. Trim handle drag → Segment trimming
   3. Long press → Initiate drag mode
   4. Drag from center → Reorder (if drag mode active)
   5. Single tap → Select segment
   6. Double tap → Open segment details
   ```

6. **State Management**:
   - **Timeline State**:
     - Current zoom level
     - Scroll position
     - Selected segment(s)
     - Playhead position
     - Edit history for undo/redo
   
   - **Segment State**:
     - Original boundaries
     - Current trim points
     - Position in timeline
     - Selection status
     - Loading/processing status

7. **Performance Requirements**:
   - **Smooth Interactions**: 60 FPS during all gestures
   - **Lazy Loading**: Load only visible segment thumbnails
   - **Debouncing**: Trim operations debounced by 300ms
   - **Memory Management**: Recycle off-screen thumbnails
   - **Background Processing**: Trim/reorder operations on background thread

8. **Accessibility**:
   - **Screen Reader Support**: Segment descriptions and positions
   - **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through segments, arrow keys for fine control
   - **Touch Target Size**: Minimum 48dp for all interactive elements
   - **High Contrast Mode**: Clear segment boundaries and selection states

9. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Segment**: Disable reorder, maintain trim functionality
   - **Many Segments (20+)**: Performance optimizations, virtual scrolling
   - **Very Short Segments (<1s)**: Enlarged trim handles for usability
   - **Very Long Timeline (>10min)**: Chunked loading, level-of-detail rendering

10. **Integration Points**:
    - **Video Player**: Sync playhead position
    - **Export Service**: Apply timeline edits to final video
    - **Undo System**: Track all timeline modifications
    - **Auto-Save**: Persist timeline state periodically

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use Compose's `pointerInput` modifier for gesture detection
- Implement custom `Layout` for optimal segment positioning
- Consider using `Canvas` for time ruler and playhead rendering
- Leverage `AnimatedVisibility` for smooth state transitions
- Use `remember` and `derivedStateOf` for performance optimization

### Issue: Timeline Gesture Fixes [TIMELINE-FIXES]
**Problem**: VideoTimelineSimple.kt had multiple gesture handling issues affecting user experience:
1. Right edge trimming caused segments to move unexpectedly
2. Segment selection was triggered by swipe gestures instead of only tap
3. No visual feedback during drag & drop operations

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Right Edge Trim Anchor Fix**:
   - **Problem**: When trimming from the right edge, the segment would jump/move as the width changed
   - **Root Cause**: Segment was positioned based on its left edge, so width changes affected visual position
   - **Solution**: Use left edge as anchor point when trimming from right:
   ```kotlin
   // In VideoSegmentItem composable
   var rightTrimAnchorX by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }
   
   // During right trim drag start:
   onDragStart = { offset ->
       if (offset.x > size.width - edgeThreshold) {
           trimType = TrimType.RIGHT
           rightTrimAnchorX = segment.startTime * pixelsPerSecond  // Lock left edge position
       }
   }
   
   // Apply position adjustment during right trim:
   .offset(x = if (trimType == TrimType.RIGHT) rightTrimAnchorX.dp else 0.dp)
   ```

2. **Segment Selection Fix**:
   - **Problem**: Segments were being selected/deselected during swipe gestures, making selection unpredictable
   - **Root Cause**: Selection logic was inside the drag gesture handler without proper filtering
   - **Solution**: Separate tap detection from drag gestures:
   ```kotlin
   .pointerInput(segment.id, isSelected) {
       detectTapGestures(
           onTap = {
               // Only toggle selection on tap, not during drag
               onSegmentSelected(segment.id)
           }
       )
   }
   .pointerInput(segment.id, isSelected) {
       detectDragGestures(
           onDragStart = { offset ->
               // Drag only works if segment is already selected
               if (!isSelected) return@detectDragGestures
               // Handle drag/trim logic
           }
       )
   }
   ```

3. **Drag & Drop Preview Implementation**:
   - **Problem**: No visual indication of where a dragged segment would be placed
   - **Solution**: Added preview box that shows drop position:
   ```kotlin
   // State for drop preview
   var dropPreviewIndex by remember { mutableStateOf(-1) }
   
   // Calculate drop position during drag
   onDrag = { change, _ ->
       val currentX = draggedSegmentOffset + change.position.x
       dropPreviewIndex = calculateDropIndex(currentX, segments)
   }
   
   // Render preview box at drop position
   if (dropPreviewIndex >= 0 && isDraggingAny) {
       Box(
           modifier = Modifier
               .width(draggedSegment.duration.seconds.dp * currentZoom * 20)
               .height(78.dp)
               .border(3.dp, Color.Yellow.copy(alpha = 0.8f), RoundedCornerShape(4.dp))
               .background(Color.Yellow.copy(alpha = 0.1f))
       )
   }
   ```

**Key Improvements**:
- Trimming now feels natural with stable segment positioning
- Selection is predictable and only responds to intentional taps
- Drag & drop provides clear visual feedback about the operation
- All gestures work smoothly without conflicts

**Result**: The timeline now provides a professional editing experience with responsive, predictable gestures and clear visual feedback for all operations.

### v12 Timeline Fixes [TIMELINE-V12]

**Timeline Improvements Implemented**:

1. **Left Edge Trim Fix** [BUG-FIX]:
   - **Problem**: When trimming from the left edge, the segment would jump unexpectedly as it was dragged past its end point
   - **Root Cause**: The trim logic allowed the left edge to be dragged beyond the segment's right edge, causing position calculation errors
   - **Solution**: Implemented proper constraint to keep the right edge anchored during left trim:
   ```kotlin
   // In VideoSegmentItem - Left trim constraint
   val maxLeftTrim = (segment.endTime - segment.startTime - 0.5f) * pixelsPerSecond
   val newLeftTrim = (leftTrimOffset + dragAmount).coerceIn(0f, maxLeftTrim)
   ```
   - **Result**: Left edge trim now stops at the minimum duration (0.5s), preventing the segment from jumping or inverting

2. **Enhanced Drag to Reorder UX** [FEATURE]:
   - **Visual Improvements**:
     - Increased shadow elevation from 8.dp to 24.dp for better depth perception
     - Increased scale factor from 1.05x to 1.1x for clearer dragging state
     - Added transparency (0.8 alpha) to see content underneath while dragging
     - Thicker border (3.dp) with primary color for better visibility
   
   - **Drop Indicator Enhancement**:
     - Replaced box-style drop preview with vertical line indicator
     - Yellow line (4.dp width) shows exact insertion point between segments
     - More precise and less visually intrusive than preview boxes
     - Implementation:
     ```kotlin
     // Vertical line drop indicator
     Box(
         modifier = Modifier
             .offset(x = insertionX.dp)
             .width(4.dp)
             .height(80.dp)
             .background(Color.Yellow.copy(alpha = 0.8f))
     )
     ```

3. **Removed Automatic Segment Snapping** [BUG-FIX]:
   - **Problem**: After trim operations, adjacent segments would automatically snap together, causing unexpected movement
   - **Root Cause**: `snapSegmentsTogether()` was being called after every trim operation
   - **Solution**: Removed the automatic snap behavior after trim operations
   - **Benefit**: Segments now stay in their positions after trimming, giving users full control over gap management
   - **Code Change**:
   ```kotlin
   // Removed this line from onDragEnd:
   // snapSegmentsTogether()  // This was causing unwanted segment movement
   ```

**Overall Impact**:
- Timeline editing now feels more predictable and professional
- Visual feedback is clearer and more intuitive
- Users have precise control over segment positioning and trimming
- No unexpected segment movements or position jumps
- Drag and drop provides better visual cues about the operation

1. **Tutorial System Updates**:
   - **Separated Tutorials**: Created dedicated tutorials for manual editing and voice editing
   - **Manual Editor Tutorial**: Updated to reflect current UI and gesture controls
   - **Voice Edit Tutorial**: New component `VoiceEditTutorial.kt` shows examples of voice commands
   - **Smart Tutorial Display**: Tutorial shows on first use of each feature
   - **Persistence**: Uses SharedPreferences to track which tutorials have been shown

2. **Gesture Animation Improvements**:
   - **Smooth Reordering**: Added spring animations for segment repositioning
   - **Alpha Transitions**: Segments fade during drag (0.8 alpha) for better visual feedback
   - **No Strobing**: Removed jarring instant position changes, replaced with animated transitions
   - **Spring Configuration**: 
     ```kotlin
     animationSpec = spring(
         dampingRatio = 0.8f,
         stiffness = 300f
     )
     ```

3. **Session Management Fix**:
   - **Problem**: Creating new video after editing kept old segments in editor
   - **Solution**: Added smart session detection in `VideoEditorViewModel`:
     ```kotlin
     if (isManualMode) {
         val currentVideoUris = segments.map { it.sourceUri }.toSet()
         val newVideoUris = selectedVideos.map { it.uri.toString() }.toSet()
         if (currentVideoUris != newVideoUris) {
             clearAllState()  // Clear old session
         }
     }
     ```
   - **New Method**: `clearAllState()` properly cleans up all editor state and temporary files

4. **Auto-Save on Exit**:
   - **Problem**: Exiting editor without saving lost all edits
   - **Solution**: Implemented automatic save when user exits editor:
     ```kotlin
     navigationIcon = {
         IconButton(onClick = {
             if (timelineState.segments.isNotEmpty()) {
                 coroutineScope.launch {
                     val tempPath = viewModel.exportToTempFile { }
                     val updatedEditPlan = viewModel.getUpdatedEditPlan()
                     onSave(tempPath, updatedEditPlan)
                 }
             } else {
                 onExit()
             }
         })
     }
     ```
   - **Applied to**: Both back arrow and "Exit" button
   - **User Experience**: Seamless - video is saved automatically, no data loss

5. **Fixed Timeline Gesture Issues**:
   - **Left Trim Movement**: Segments no longer shift position when trimming from left edge
   - **Simplified Gestures**: Removed long press requirement - all gestures work on swipe
   - **Wider Touch Zones**: Trim handles extended to 32dp for easier interaction
   - **Instant Feedback**: All visual changes follow finger movement immediately

**Result**: 
- Professional editing experience with smooth animations
- No data loss when switching between videos or exiting
- Clear, context-aware tutorials for each feature
- Responsive gestures without delays or glitches
- Proper session management prevents confusion between projects

### v12 Final Fixes [TIMELINE-V12-FINAL]

**Latest Bug Fixes and Improvements (December 2024)**:

1. **Tutorial Display for Manual Editing**:
   - **Problem**: Tutorial wasn't showing when entering editor via "Edit Manually" button
   - **Solution**: Added check for manual mode (`isManualMode`) in tutorial display logic
   - **Code**: `var showTutorial by remember { mutableStateOf(!hasShownVideoEditorTutorial || (isManualMode && !hasShownVideoEditorTutorial)) }`
   - **Result**: Tutorial now correctly shows for first-time manual editing

2. **Tutorial Text Updates**:
   - Removed "все изменения применяются мгновенно" (instant changes)
   - Changed "свайпните по ним" to "двигайте их для обрезки" (move them to trim)
   - Updated "для перемещения сегмента зажмите и перемещайте его" (hold and move)
   - Removed "видео проигрывается в реальном времени" (real-time playback)
   - Simplified save message to "Сохраните ваше видео" (Save your video)

3. **Zoom Button Fix After Centering**:
   - **Problem**: +/- zoom buttons stopped working after using "fit all" button
   - **Root Cause**: Buttons couldn't find index in ZOOM_LEVELS for arbitrary zoom values
   - **Solution**: Changed logic to find nearest zoom level instead of exact match:
   ```kotlin
   // Find nearest smaller zoom
   val smallerZooms = ZOOM_LEVELS.filter { it < currentZoom }
   val newZoom = if (smallerZooms.isNotEmpty()) {
       smallerZooms.last().coerceAtLeast(minZoom)
   } else {
       (currentZoom - 0.5f).coerceAtLeast(minZoom)
   }
   ```

4. **Smooth Segment Reordering Animation**:
   - **Problem**: Segments jumped/strobed when reordering instead of animating smoothly
   - **Solution**: Added `animateItemPlacement` with spring animation:
   ```kotlin
   Box(
       modifier = Modifier.animateItemPlacement(
           animationSpec = spring(
               dampingRatio = 0.8f,
               stiffness = 400f
           )
       )
   ) { VideoSegmentSimple(...) }
   ```
   - **Result**: Smooth, professional-looking segment reordering

5. **Auto-Save Progress Indicator**:
   - **Problem**: App appeared frozen when auto-saving on exit
   - **Solution**: Added loading dialog with progress indicator:
   ```kotlin
   if (showAutoSaveIndicator) {
       AlertDialog(
           title = { Text("Сохранение видео...") },
           text = {
               Column {
                   CircularProgressIndicator()
                   Text("Пожалуйста, подождите")
               }
           }
       )
   }
   ```

6. **Trim Extension Fix**:
   - **Problem**: Couldn't extend trimmed segments back to original length
   - **Root Cause**: Using `startTime`/`endTime` instead of `inPoint`/`outPoint` for limits
   - **Solution**: Changed trim constraints to use original video boundaries:
   ```kotlin
   // Allow expansion to original video start
   val maxLeftExpansion = -segment.inPoint * PIXELS_PER_SECOND * zoomLevel
   // Allow expansion to original video end  
   val maxExpansion = segment.originalDuration - segment.outPoint
   ```
   - **Result**: Segments can now be trimmed and extended within original video boundaries

**Final State**: 
All reported issues have been resolved. The video editor now provides a smooth, professional editing experience with:
- Proper tutorial display for all entry points
- Responsive zoom controls in all states
- Smooth animations without visual glitches
- Clear feedback during all operations
- Full trim/extend functionality within video bounds
